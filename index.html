        <h2>This website is currently under construction</h2>
        <p>DCP is a non-profit co-operative preschool organized by Dalhousie faculty parents, and run for the children by the parents, alongside registered ECEs. Our Membership is open to all researchers and staff affiliated with Dalhousie University. Our members are expected to volunteer as a classroom assistant once a month, and to contribute to one of our Board Roles (see Membership).</p>
        <p>Our registered ECEs deliver high quality pedagogical programming that guides children's' growth, social skills, and cognitive development. We believe that all children are intelligent, capable of complex emotions and thoughts, curious, and with an outstanding potential. We provide an inclusive environment that welcomes everybody and lets our children to learn through play and build on their strengths and abilities.</p>
        <p>We are currently organizing space, staff, and logistics, and intend to open our operations as a part-time daycare (8:00 - 12:00 no nap) for toddlers and preschoolers, with the potential to scale to longer days.</p>
