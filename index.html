    <p>Dalhousie Cooperative Preschool (DCP) is a non-profit co-operative preschool run for the children by the parents. 
    Our preschool employes registered ECEs alongside our parent volunteers to deliver high quality pedagogical programming that guided childrens' growth and development. 
    We believe that all children are intelligent, capable of complex emotions and thoughts, curious, and capable of realizing an outstanding potential. 
    We provide an inclusive environment that welcomes everybody and allows our children to learn through play, and build on their strengths and abilities.</p>
