        <p>DCP is a non-profit co-operative preschool organized and run by Dalhousie faculty parents, alongside registered ECEs. Our Membership is open to all researchers, staff and students affiliated with Dalhousie University. However, as this daycare is part of an equity initiative aimed at women (and all primary caregivers) in Computer Science and Engineering, priority placement will be given to parents in this category. 
        </p>

        <p>A Coop bussiness model means that parents (or another designated adult from their household) are expected to participate in running the daycare. Participation includes, for example -- (1) serving as a classroom assistant for one day a month and/or (2) serving on the Membership Board in roles such as Communications Officer, or School Improvement Officer or (3) contributing service in other ways such as shopping or repairs. Your participation is estimated to involve 4 hours a month, on average. In addition to parent volunteers, daycare also employs a limited number of staff -- most importantly registered EC educators, so that a volunteer will never be left alone with children -- and an admin staffer, who will be taking over part of the administrative roles as we scale up.  We are will also accept current students from Psychology programs, who wish to participate in a work placement program with DCP. </p>  
            
        <p>Our registered ECEs deliver high quality pedagogical programming that guides childrens' growth, social skills, and cognitive development. We believe that all children are intelligent, curious, creative, and capable of complex emotions. We provide an inclusive environment that welcomes everybody, allows our children learn through play, and builds on their strengths and abilities.</p>
        
        <p>We are currently organizing space, staff, and logistics, and intend to begin our operations as a part-time daycare (8:00 - 12:00 no nap) for toddlers and preschoolers, potentially scaling up to longer days in the future.</p>
